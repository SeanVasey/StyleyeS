# Images Setup Instructions

This directory contains the visual assets for the StyleyeS repository.

## Required Images

### 1. Documentation Banner (`styleyes-banner.png`)
**Location:** `images/styleyes-banner.png`

This is the simple, clean banner image used in the README documentation.

**Specifications:**
- Simple dark background with the StyleyeS logo
- "VASEY/AI PRESENTS" header text
- Eye icon with gradient colors (orange to pink/purple)
- "StyleyeS v1.5" title with gradient text
- Tagline: "The vivid prompt engineering studio."
- Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or similar 16:9 ratio

**Current Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS TO BE ADDED
- Save the first image you have as `styleyes-banner.png` in this directory

### 2. Repository Cover Image (`styleyes-cover.png`)
**Location:** `images/styleyes-cover.png`

This is the elaborate, eye-catching cover image for the GitHub repository social preview.

**Specifications:**
- Cosmic/tech background with orange, pink, and purple color scheme
- Particles and light effects
- UI mockup elements visible in the background
- Same branding elements as banner (logo, title, tagline)
- More visually rich and detailed than the banner
- Recommended dimensions: 1280x640 (GitHub's social preview ratio)

**Current Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS TO BE ADDED
- Save the second image you have as `styleyes-cover.png` in this directory

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add the Images to This Directory

1. Save your first image (simple banner) as:
   ```
   images/styleyes-banner.png
   ```

2. Save your second image (elaborate cover) as:
   ```
   images/styleyes-cover.png
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository Social Preview

The cover image needs to be set as the repository's social preview image on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/SeanVasey/StyleyeS`
2. Click **Settings** (repository settings, not personal settings)
3. Scroll down to the **Social preview** section
4. Click **Edit** or **Upload an image**
5. Upload `images/styleyes-cover.png`
6. The image will now appear when you share the repository on social media, GitHub feeds, etc.

**Note:** The social preview image is separate from the README banner. The banner appears in the README, while the social preview appears on GitHub's repository page and when sharing links.

### Step 3: Verify

After adding the images and pushing to GitHub:

1. Check that the banner appears at the top of the README
2. Verify the social preview by viewing your repository on GitHub
3. Share the repository link to see the cover image in the preview

## Image Format Notes

- **PNG format** is recommended for best quality with transparency support
- **JPG/JPEG** can be used if file size is a concern
- Ensure images are optimized for web (not too large in file size)
- GitHub has a 10MB limit for social preview images

## Need Help?

If the images don't appear:
- Check that the file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify the images are in the correct directory
- Ensure the files are committed and pushed to GitHub
- Clear your browser cache if the old preview is cached
